# teensy-libcurve
nice curves for st7735_t3 library (work in progess)

* wouldnt it be awesome if we could display SVG files on teensy? 
* also, I really hate lines that are not antialiased...  (but there is an option to turn it on and off)
* and thirdly I'd like to be able to compile and debug on linux...
* This is not an efficient way of calculating a bezier curve. 
* Some work to do when antialiasing and curve changes from steep to not steep or visa versa.
